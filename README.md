# Klasopdracht Webdevelopment 3 - Graduaat Internet of Things

The idea is that in A306, A308, B302, B303, B304 and B306 IoT devices will be deployed with a SCD30 sensor that periodicaly will register Temperature, Humidity and CO2 to a PHP application on the server by use of API key's. The data will be stored in a MySQL database.

## Setup Server

On the server we use XAMPP so Apache with PHP and MySQL is available.

### Setup the database

In order to setup of restore the database follow [these instructions](/database/README.md).

### Setup the application

In order to setup the web application follow [these instructions](/server/README.md)

## Setup a IoT device

In order to setup a new IoT Device follow [these instructions](/iotdevice/README.md)

## Use the WEBapi 

[Here](/client/README.md) you can see a basic use of the WEBapi in a client-side web application.
